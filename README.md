### Advent of Code

This repo is my yearly attempt at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).  
I've competed every year since it's inception and at this point its become a bit of an addiction ðŸ¤ª.
It's a pretty good opportunity to learn a new language and have some light-hearted competition against my colleagues.

I do try keep the code readable, but I make no promises. Take a look but don't try to use this code for anything you care about; there are many libraries written by people plenty smarter than me and vetted by a community.
This repo is intended for learning purposes, primary my own and secondly for others.
